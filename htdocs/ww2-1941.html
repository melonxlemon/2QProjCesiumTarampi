                <summary>The Blitz</summary>
                <p>The Blitz is a continuation of the Battle of Britain, wherein the Luftwaffe concentrated more on strategic bombing after their failure to gain air superiority. The bombings lessened drastically after the start of Operation Barbarossa.</p>

                <summary>Axis invasion of the Balkans</summary>
                <p>After Italian failure in the initial invasion of Greece, Germany had to help them. The problem was there were neutral countries between them and Greece. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria opted to join the Axis but the Yugoslavian government was overthrown, replaced by pro-British nationalists. Germany would simultaneously invade Yugoslavia and Greece. Although the victory was swift, the Yugoslavians resisted occupation, and the Germans had to deal with them until the end of the war.</p>

                <summary>British counter-attacks on Italian Africa and the Middle East</summary>
                <p>The British, having secured the English Channel, had attacked the East and North Italian territories days before the end of 1940. By February 1941, they had pushed out Italy out of Eastern Libya. This prompted the Germans to send an expeditionary force under Erwin Rommel. Rommel's forces pushed the British out of Libya and could have continued until El Alamein but an Australian force defended the key port of Tobruk, hampering the supply of the Axis. On May, the British would quash a pro-Axis rebellion and invaded Vichy French Syria and Lebanon.</p>

                <summary>Invasion of Russia 1941</summary>
                <p>With the situation in Europe relatively stable, Germany prepared for a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, which had been Hitler's main goal (Lebensraum). On June 22, 1941, the Axis, along with Finland, waged war against the Soviet Union. The Soviets were shocked and with most of their military staff purged, the Red Army was weak. The Germans made staggering progress, encircling 250,000 men at Bialystok and Minsk, 300,000 at Smolensk, 660,000 men at Kiev, another 660,000 men at Vyazma and Bryansk, and besieging Leningrad. They were ordered to push to Moscow, but by winter, the Germans were undersupplied and tired, and the Red Army, being skilled in winter warfare, launched a counter-attack, pushing the Germans around 200 miles back. The Germans had no choice but to settle in and hold a defensive position until winter ended.</p>

                <summary>Attack on Pearl Harbor</summary>
                <p>With the Sino-Japanese war coming to a stalemate, the Japanese thought of other plans to expand. They looked to the South, but it was heavily colonized and protected by the Allies. The Imperial Japanese Navy did not stand a chance against the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, so they decided to attack their navies first to allow for a Southern expansion. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked the fleet on Pearl Harbor. Simultaneously, they attacked the Philippines, Guam, Malaya, Thailand, and Hong Kong (Thailand allied with Japan after). This prompted the Allies to finally declare war on Japan. The members of the Tripartite Pact declared war on the US to support Japan.</p>
