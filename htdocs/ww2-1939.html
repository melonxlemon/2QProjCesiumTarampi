				<summary>Start of World War II</summary>
				<h3>Invasion of Poland</h3>
				<p>The war officialy started on September 1, 1939 at 04:45 (Fall Weiss), when German battleship Schelswig-Holstein open fires on the port of Danzig. The first German attack came on the Polish defence on Westerplatte. The Allies sent an ultimatum to Germany to cease all military actions, to which it was ignored. They officially declared war on September 3, but did almost nothing to save the Poles from the invasion.
				On September 8, the Germans reached Warsaw, but was met by a counter-attack. On September 17, after signing a non-aggression pact with Japan, the Soviet Union invaded the Poles from the East. The Poles were not able to defend a two-front war, and on the 27th of September, the Polish garrison surrendered. What was left of the Polish army, including the government, continued to fight with the Allies until 1945.</p>

				<summary>Battle of the Atlantic</summary>
				<p>The Kriegsmarine did not have enough power to beat the Royal Navy, so they resorted to convoy raiding in the Atlantic. This went well, especially with the U-boats, as they were able to sink over 13 million tons up to 1945. The Germans were dominating the battle until July 1941, when Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park finally solved the German code that was the Enigma. From there on, U-boats became less and less of a threat.</p>

				<summary>Soviet expansion</summary>
				<h3>Baltic expansion</h3>
				<p>The Soviets threatened Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania a military invasion, which forced them to surrender to them.</p>
				<h3>Winter War</h3>
				<p>The Soviets also threatened the Finns, but when they didn't surrender, the Soviets declared war on them. Surprisingly, the Finns exposed the ineptitude of the Soviet Army. The Soviets still had numerical and industrial advantage, and on March 1940, the Finns agreed to make peace with a little bit of Finnish concessions.</p>
