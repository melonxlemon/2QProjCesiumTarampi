                <summary>Aftermath of World War I</summary>
                <h3>German Empire</h3>
                <p>With the German Army losing, the Germans revolted and thus formed the Weimar Republic to replace the monarchy. The Paris peace conference that ensued forced the said country to demilitarize, lose territory, and pay heavy amounts of economic reparations. This caused political and economic instability, and the rising of new political parties, wherein the Nazis would come out victorious.</p>
                <h3>Austro-Hungarian Empire</h3>
                <p>The Treaties of Trianon and Saint-Germain abolished the Empire, creating Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and ceded territory to Serbia (which made Yugoslavia), Poland, and Romania.</p>
                <h3>Ottoman Empire</h3>
                <p>The Treaty of Sevres crashed the Ottoman government, causing revolution and the treaty of Lausanne. Its territories in the Middle East created countries that paved way to the Middle East today. The Ottoman mainland became Turkey.</p>
                <h3>Russian Empire</h3>
                <p>The Russian Revolution continued to the Russian civil war, wherein the Soviets won. This formed the Soviet Union. Territories lost in WW1 were regained except for Finland, Poland, the Baltic States, and Bessarabia.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>The Great Depression</summary>
                <p>The stock market crash of 1929 is known to have started the Great Depression. It would go global by the 1930s and would last until 1939 for some countries. GDPs fell and deflation occurred, which caused the global economy to crash. This, in turn, helped the Nazis rise to power and also solidified Stalin's rule on the Soviet Union.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Sino-Japanese War</summary>
                <p>The first Sino-Japanese War ended in a victory for Japan, taking Korea, Taiwan, and some more territory. Eager for more resources and land, it continued the war by and puppeting Manchuria. The war officialy continued after the Marco Polo incident, with Japan sweeping through Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Nanjing. It was here that the Japanese would make atrocities, like the Rape of Nanjing. </p>

            <details>
                <summary>The Axis Powers</summary>
                <p>The rise of the Nazis paved way for aggressive foreign policy. They started to rearm and violate the treaty of Versailles by remilitarizing the Rhineland. It would make an alliance with Italy and Japan in 1937, then claim Austria, Czechoslovakia, Memel, and Danzig, namely the last one being the cause of World War 2. Italy invaded Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1936 and annexed Albania in 1939.</p>
