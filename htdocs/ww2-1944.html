                <h3>Leningrad-Novgorod offensive</h3>
                <p>With the victories in the South, the Soviets turned North. They pushed through the Leningrad region and successfully ended the Siege of Leningrad that caused more than a million casualties. It would be halted on the Estonian border by the German Army Group North.</p>
                <h3>Dnieper-Carpathian offensive</h3>
                <p>The Soviets looked to the South again. They liberated Crimea and pushed the front to its original border back in 1939, and they even captured some land in Romania.</p>
                <h3>Operation Bagration</h3>
                <p>The Soviets would launch a strategic offensive in Belarus which would almost completely destroy the German Army Group Center. The Soviets continued to push until Eastern Poland, wherein it stopped during the Warsaw Uprising. The Soviets continued attacking in Eastern Romania and successfully destroyed the German army there. They would also trigger successful coups d'etat in Romania and Bulgaria, followed by those countries switching to the Allies. The Soviets continued their advance through the Balkans which forced the German armies in Greece and Yugoslavia to retreat. In its war with the Finnish, the Soviets would sign an armistice that forced the Finnish to join the Allies. To finish the operation, they attacked German-occupied Hungary, which lasted until February 1945.</p>

                <p>On March 1944, the Japanese launched an offensive in Assam, India, and would besiege the British at Imphal and Kohima. However, the British launched a counter-attack that pushed the Japanese back to Burma by July, and the Chinese at Northern Burma would besiege the Japanese troops in Myitkyina. While this was happening, the Japanese would launch another invasion on China, this time capturing Henan, Hengyang, Guangxi, and Changsha.</p>
                <h3>Allied offensivs</h3>
                <p>The Americans would start an offensive on the Mariana and Palau islands. They decisively defeated the IJN again on the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In late October, American forces invaded the Philippines, starting with Leyte, and winning another naval battle on Leyte Gulf. They would finally liberate the Philippines around April next year.</p>

                <h3>Operation Overlord</h3>
                <p>Operation Overlord was the Allied invasion of Northern france on the 6th of June, 1944. This was the largest amphibious invasion, including more than 5,000 vessels and 160,000 men in the initial phase, more than 2 million by the end of August. The plan was for the Americans to land at beaches Utah and Omaha, the British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno. Led by Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and Bernard Montgomery, the Allies would form the beachheads, and would soon link up. The Allied force captured the Cherbourg port on the 26th and Caen on July 21. This was followed by Operation Dragoon on the 15th of August.</p>
                <h3>Operation Dragoon</h3>
                <p>Operation Dragoon was the Allied invasion of Vichy France on the 15th of August, 1944. The Allies landed on the beaches of the Cote d'Azur. With French resistance and Allied air superiority, the Germans were defeated and retreated to Dijon. Meanwhile, the French would capture the ports of Marseille and Toulon, fixing their supply problems. The Germans were unable to hold it and had to retreat. On August 15, Paris was soon liberated. This along with the German retreat marked the end of the Operations.</p>
