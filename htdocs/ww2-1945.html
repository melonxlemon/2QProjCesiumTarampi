                <h3>Western Front</h3>
                <p>The Germans would commit one final couter-offensive in the Western Front by trying to recreate the blitzkrieg through the Ardennes forest. They managed to push through and siege an American army in Bastogne, but the counter-offensive was quickly repulsed by the Allies and with it, the Western front fully collapsed. The Allies would enter Germany in February and meet up with the Soviets on May.</p>
                <h3>Eastern Front</h3>
                <p>The Red Army would push the remaining Germans to the Oder river in Poland. The fast movements made their flanks unprotected, so they had to halt and delay the attack to Berlin to April. In February, the German army made its final counter-offensive in the war itself on Hungary, which was quickly repulsed. The Red Army captured Berlin on the 29th of April, and on May 8, 1945, the Germans would surrender, and the European theater was put to rest.</p>

                <h3>Pacific Front</h3>
                <p>The Americans finally liberated the Philippines on May. They would then launch firebombing campaigns over Japan and enter Borneo on the same month. The British would push the Japanese out of Burma on March, and the Americans would go on an island-hopping campaign, taking Iwo Jima and Okinawa by the end of June. The Allies would finally demand unconditional surrender from Japan, to which it declined. The Allied response was the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan finally surrendered on August 15, signing the surrender documents on September 2. World War 2 would finally end.</p>
