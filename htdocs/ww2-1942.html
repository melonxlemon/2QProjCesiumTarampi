                <summary>The Pacific War continues</summary>
                <h3>Territorial expansion</h3>
                <p>By April 1942, the Japanese, along with Thailand, had already or almost fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, and were now threatening Northern Australia and New Guinea. Despite strong resistance from the Filipinos and Americans in the Philippines, the country soon fell on May. These victories made the Japanese overconfident, but they were extended, and thus counter-attacks from the Allies set them back.</p>
                <h3>Battle of Midway</h3>
                <p>The Battle of Midway was a decisive victory for the USN. It destroyed 4 aircraft carriers, 248 aircraft, 1 cruiser and 1 destroyer. The victory was the turning point of the Pacific War, as the IJN did not recover ever since. This also allowed for counter-attacks on Guadalcanal, New Guinea, and the defense of Australia.</p>

                <summary>Fall Blau</summary>
                <p>The failure to force a quick victory against the Soviets led to a change of plans for the Germans. The new plans were initiated on June 1942 to occupy the oil-rich Caucasus. Army Group South was split in two: Army Group A to invade the Caucasus and Army Group B to reinforce their flank on the Volga River. The Germans were winning again until they reached Stalingrad. The German 6th Army was sent alone to take Stalingrad and it was met with fierce resistance. When they had almost took the city, they were met with a Soviet counter-attack that encircled the 6th Army, which would surrender after 5 months of fighting. With the flank exposed, Army Group B had no choice but to retreat, reversing the gains of the summer campaign. This would be the turning point of the Eastern front, and the Germans would never be able to take the initiative again.</p>

                <summary>African campaign</summary>
                <p>With the British out of Libya, they continued to attack until El Alamein, to which the offensive was stopped. The Axis tried once again, and with another loss came the Allied counter-attack. Landings in French North Africa, pushing the Axis out of Egypt, and the invasion of Madagascar would soon lead to the retreat of the Axis from Africa.</p>
