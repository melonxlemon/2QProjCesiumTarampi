                <h3>Denmark Invasion</h3>
                <p>Operation Weserubung started on the 9th of April. Germany orders the Danish to surrender to avoid civilian bombing. They oblige quickly.</p>
                <h3>Norway Invasion</h3>
                <p>The Germans first took Oslo and Trondheim, followed by Lillehammer. The Germans finally broke through on May 1, when the Allies started to retreat. The Germans officially won on June 10.</p>

                <summary>Battle of France</summary>
                <p>The Germans invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in an attempt to go around the heavily fortified Maginot Line. The Allies entered the countries and everyone thought that WW1 was simply going to repeat. Suddenly, the German Army burst through the underdefended Ardennes, for it was thought to be impenetrable. By implementing blitzkrieg, they succeeded in encircling the best French armies and the British Expeditionary Force. Although they failed to destroy the BEF (Dunkirk evacuation), the French military mostly was, and they swept through com%2Fevent%2FBattle-of-France-World-War-II
                France surrendered, Vichy France was formed, and Italy finally declared war on the Allies.</p>

                <summary>Italian campaign</summary>
                <p>The Italians started their war with the British by besieging Malta. They continued with the invasion of British Somaliland and Egypt. With these successes, they invaded Greece, which went badly. The Germans had to prevent possible British domination, so they prepared for a Balkan invasion.</p>

                <summary>Battle of Britain</summary>
                <p>Following the failure at Norway, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned and was replaced by Winston Churchill. Even with all the victories of the Axis, he remained brave and did not surrender. This prompted the Germans to prepare for a naval invasion of Britain. For this to happen, they needed air and naval superiority over the English Channel. The Luftwaffe started strategic bombing over ports, harbors, factories, air bases and more. In one final fight, the Royal Air Force defeated the Luftwaffe, forcing the Germans to abandon the planned invasion altogether.</p>
